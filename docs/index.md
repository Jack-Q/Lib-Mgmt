Introduction
============

Library is one of the most important place for students, teachers, scholars,
researchers, etc. to acquire information and knowledge. An effective way to
manage the books (as well as other materials) is the key point for all of
the libraries around the world to execute and perform their roles.

Functions
---------

We would like to provide a light-weighted solution for those library in a
fairly small scale. However, this does never mean that this solution lack
any basic functions a web management system should have, including users
and roles management, batch process for books, multiply means to search for
books, renting management, etc. For more descriptions about function modules
 of this project, please refer to [modules](modules.md)

Architecture
------------
This project is a Java solution in B/S (Browser & Server) architecture.
